# Collatz Sequence Generator

## Description
This Python script generates the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer.

## Usage
1. Run the script using Python.
2. Enter a positive integer.
3. The script will generate the Collatz sequence for the entered number.

## Notes
- The Collatz sequence is a sequence of numbers produced by following a simple rule: if the current number is even, divide it by 2; if it is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
- The sequence eventually reaches the number 1.
- This script demonstrates the Collatz sequence using a while loop and appending each number to a list.
