# Weekday Checker

## Description
This Python script checks whether the current day is a weekday or weekend and prints the result.

## Usage
1. Run the script using Python.
2. The script will determine the current day of the week and display whether it's a weekday or weekend.

## Notes
- The script uses the `datetime` module to get the current date and time.
- It makes a note of the weekday number from the current datetime object.
- A list `days_of_week` is defined to map weekday numbers to day names.
- The current day is printed using the mapped day name.
- It then checks whether it's a weekday (Monday to Friday) or a weekend (Saturday or Sunday) and prints the related message.
