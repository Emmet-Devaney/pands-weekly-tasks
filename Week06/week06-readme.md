# Square Root Calculator

## Description
This Python script calculates the square root of a positive number using the Newton-Raphson method.

## Usage
1. Run the script using Python.
2. Enter a positive number when prompted.
3. The script will calculate the square root of the entered number using the Newton-Raphson method and print the result.


## Details
- The script defines a function `square_root()` to calculate the square root of a positive number.
- It prompts the user to enter a positive number and converts the input to a floating-point number.
- If the entered number is not positive, it prints an error message and exits.
- The Newton-Raphson method is used to calculate the square root until the desired accuracy is achieved.
- The epsilon value is an arbitrary positive number used to determine the accuracy of the calculation. It can be adjusted for higher or lower accuracy.
- The calculated square root is printed as the output.

## Notes
- The Newton-Raphson method is an algorithm used to find approximations to the roots of a real-valued function.
- This script demonstrates the Newton-Raphson method for calculating square roots.
